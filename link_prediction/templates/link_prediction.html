        <h1>Link Prediction</h1>
        <p>Link prediction is a task of predicting the existence of a link between two nodes in a network. In this project, we are going to predict the existence of a link between two companies in the semiconductor supply chain. We further look at the factors that are important in predicting the links as well.

        <h2>Training Dataset</h2>
        <p>The training dataset consists of 502296 pairs of nodes in the semiconductor supply chain. The positive edges were the relationships already in the network and the negative pairs were generated by sampling from the network. The relationships were filtered using the supply relationship starting year to be less than 2021.

        <h2>Validation Dataset</h2>
        <p>The validation dataset consists of 337152 pairs of nodes in the semiconductor supply chain. The edges were developed as similar to the training dataset. The relationships were filtered using the supply relationship starting year to be less than 2022 and greater than 2021.

        <h2>Testing Dataset</h2>
        <p>The testing dataset consists of 87456 pairs of nodes in the semiconductor supply chain. The positive edges were the relationships already in the network and the negative pairs were generated by sampling from the network. The relationships were filtered using the supply relationship starting year to be greater than 2022. Below you can see how the test dataset looks like.
